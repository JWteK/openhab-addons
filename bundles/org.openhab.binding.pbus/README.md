#Pbus Binding

The Pbus binding integrates with Siemens PTM modules connected to a PTMod via an USB-RS422/RS485 module (based on a FTDI chipset) or a network connection (TCP/IP).

The binding exposes basic actions from the Pbus System that can be triggered from the smartphone/tablet interface, as defined by the [Velbus Protocol info sheets](https://github.com/Velbus).

Supported item types are switches, dimmers and rollershutters.
